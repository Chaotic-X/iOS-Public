# Project Summary

Delegates can be used to solve many different problems. In this project, you will create and implement a custom delegate in order to communicate information from one view controller to another.

Remember that there are six steps to creating and implementing a delegate:    
  
In the child:  
1) Declare/define the delegate protocol outside of the class   
2) Declare an optional, weak property in your class with the type being your custom delegate created in Step 1  
3) Call the your delegate's function(s) at the appropriate time; e.g. when a button is tapped  
  
In the parent:  
4) Adopt the delegate   te
5) Conform to the protocol  
6) Set the adopting class as the delegate     

## Setup

Open the WizardSchool starter project in your iOS-Student folder. Familiarize yourself with the existing code. See summaries below.

### Wizard.swift

This is the model class for your project. You'll notice that this file contains two enums: 1) a wand type and 2) a trait.  

We have a computed property called `houseImage`, which is computed based on the trait that is selected. For example, if you pick 'cunning,' the house symbol for Slytherin will be returned.
   
### WizardController.swift

This is the model controller for our `Wizard` class. It is solely responsible of for creating, updating, reading, and deleting the model. In this project, it will only create new `Wizard` objects.  

### HomeViewController.swift

The subclass file for the `HomeViewController` in the storyboard. Notice in the storyboard that there are hidden UI elements. We will eventually unhide these elements after a new wizard is created.  

### EnrollViewController.swift

The subclass file for the `EnrollViewController`. This is where a person will sign up to become a wizard. 

In the `wandButtonTapped` function, we are switching on the `UIButton's` `restorationIdentifier`. A `restorationIdentifier` is just what it sounds like, it provides a way to identify a UI element in our code. We use the `restorationIdentifier` to identify which button was tapped, then set the `selectedWand` property on our view controller class so that we can later use that variable in another scope. 
   
A similar pattern occurs in the `traitButtonTapped`. We switch on the `restorationIdentifier` to find out which trait button was tapped, and we set the `selectedTrait`accordingly.

Both buttons call `inverseColor(for:)` which simply swaps the button's background/font colors to show that the button is selected.

The `formatButtons(:)` function loops through the `buttons` collection outlet, which is an array outlets for our buttons in storyboard. In the loop, the corners of the button are rounded and a border width/color is set.

## Step 1 - Declare/define the delegate protocol

### Summary

We will declare and define our delegate in this section. The `EnrollViewController` is considered the child in the parent-child relationship of the delegate. Think about how a child would report to a parent in real life. The `EnrollViewController` will be reporting to the `HomeViewController`.

### Instructions

* Open the `EnrollViewController.swift` file
* Declare and define your delegate protocol. At the top of the file and outside of the class, add the following:
	<details>
      <summary> <code> Delegate protocol declaration</code> </summary>

      ```swift
      protocol EnrollViewControllerDelegate: class  {
      		func wizardCreated(wizard: Wizard)
      }
      ``` 
   </details>
      
Let's consider the 'why' behind the code above. When the user taps on the 'Sign up' button on the `HomeViewController`, we present the `EnrollViewController`. Once the user signs up, we need a way to communicate our new `Wizard` object back to the `HomeViewController`
so that it can populate its views; otherwise, the `HomeViewController` would have no way to access the newly created `Wizard`. Although there are a few different ways to provide access to the `Wizard` object in this scenario, a delegate method works perfectly.

## Step 2 - Declare a delegate property

### Summary

We've declared a delegate protocol at this point; however, we haven't provided a way for another class to set itself as the `EnrollViewController's` delegate. So, let's declare a delegate reference. This will allow another class to set itself as the child's boss (aka the parent).  

### Instructions
* In the `EnrollViewController` class, do the following:
	<details>
		<summary> <code> Declare a delegate property</code></summary>
		```
		weak var delegate: EnrollViewControllerDelegate?
		```
		</details>

## Step 3 - Call your delegate's function

### Summary
The last action that we need to take is to create a `Wizard` object from the user's input and to call our delegate function.  

### Instructions
* Enter the following in the `saveButtonTapped(sender:)` function:
	* Unwrap the input from the user (the text field, selectedTrait, and selectedWand)
	* Initialize a new `Wizard` object using the objects that you unwrapped
	* Inform your delegate of the wizard creation by calling `wizardCreated(wizard:)` on `delegate`
	* Dismiss the `EnrollViewController`
	
	<details>
		<summary> <code> Call your delegate's function</code></summary>
		
		 // Unwrap the input from the user.
        guard let wizardName = wizardNameTextField.text, 
        	  !wizardName.isEmpty,
            let trait = selectedTrait,
            let wand = selectedWand
            else { return }
        
        // Initialize a new Wizard
        let wizard = WizardController.enroll(name: wizardName, wand: wand, trait: trait)
        
        // Call our delegate function to inform the parent that a wizard was created
        delegate?.wizardCreated(wizard: wizard)
        dismiss(animated: true, completion: nil)
        
Informing the parent that a `Wizard` object was created gives the parent an opportunity to react. In our case, we want the `HomeViewController` to update its views to reflect the properties of the wizard.

## Step 4 - Adopt the delegate protocol

### Summary

Now that the child portion of delegate protocol has been implemented, we're ready to utilize it in our parent class.  

### Instructions

* Open the `HomeViewController.swift` file
* Adopt the delegate protocol by adding the following code outside of the `HomeViewController` class:
	<details>
		<summary> <code> Adopt the delegate protocol</code></summary>
		
	```  
	extension HomeViewController: EnrollViewControllerDelegate {
		
	}
	```
	</details>
	
Note: Good code organization is very important. Adopting and conforming to delegates in an extension of the conforming class is a best practice.   

Notice that you are receiving an error from the compiler telling you that the `HomeViewController` does not conform to the `EnrollViewControllerDelegate` protocol. What's happening here is that the we have declared our `HomeViewController` as an `EnrollViewControllerDelegate`; however, in order to actually be an `EnrollViewControllerDelegate`, the adopting class must conform to the delegate. 

See Step 5 to silence the compiler.

## Step 5 - Conform to the delegate protocol

### Summary

In general, conforming to a delegate protocol means implementing any required functions or adding any required properties. Our delegate has one required function that must be implemented in order for a class to conform to our delegate protocol.

### Instructions

* Click the error and the click 'Fix.' This will add the stubs for the required function. We have now successfully conformed to the delegate protocol; however, we have more to do 
* Let's think back to our child. This method is going to get fired when the user taps the 'Save' button on the `EnrollViewController`. This is, in essence, the `EnrollViewController` reporting to the `HomeViewController`. Once the `HomeViewController` has been informed that a new wizard has been created, we need to actually update the views in the `HomeViewController`.
	* In the `wizardCreationed(wizard:)` function, call the existing `updateViews(for:)` function, and pass in the `Wizard` object that was passed into the delegate function.
	* `updateViews` should do the following:
		* Set the `welcomeLabel` text to "Welcome WizardName!"
		* Set the `yourWandLabel` text to "Your wand is WandName" Note: you will have to use the rawValue of the wand enum.
		* Set the `houseImageView` image to your wizard instance's `houseImage` property.
		* Unhide the 	`yourWandLabel`, `yourHouseLabel`, and the`houseImageView`.
		* Hide the `enrollButton`.


## Step 6 - Set the adopting class as the delegate  

### Summary

The final step in implementing the delegate is by setting the `HomeViewController` as the delegate of the `EnrollViewController`. Remember the `weak var delegate` we created on the `EnrollViewController`? We're going to use that now.

### Instructions

* First, we need an instance of the `EnrollViewController` in order to set its delegate, so we're going to have to start in `prepareForSegue(segue:sender:)`.
* In the extension (not the extension that adopted the delegate) on `HomeViewController`, start typing 'prepare.' This should autopopulate the `prepareForSegue(segue:sender)` function
* Set a segue identifier in `Main.storyboard`. In `prepareForSegue, ` check the segue's identifier.
* Unwrap the segue's destination and cast it as an `EnrollViewController`
* Set the instance's delegate to `self`.
